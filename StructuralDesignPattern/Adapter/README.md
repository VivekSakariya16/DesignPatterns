- **Adapter Design Pattern:**  
  We have a project for a bank that has an existing legacy banking system that manages customer bank accounts and related details. The bank wants to introduce a new credit card processing system that requires specific credit card-related functionality. To accommodate this change, we have implemented an adapter design pattern, which helps to adapt the new credit card functionality into the existing BankDetail system.
