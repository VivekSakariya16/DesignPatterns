- **Memento design pattern**   
  - It allows an object to capture and externalize its internal state without violating encapsulation, enabling the object to be restored to this state later.
  - It promotes a clear separation of responsibilities: the Originator manages the state and creates mementos, the Memento stores the state snapshot, and the CareTaker manages the mementos without accessing the Originator's state directly.
  - This pattern is useful for implementing undo/redo functionality, checkpointing, transaction-based systems, and other scenarios where an object's state needs to be saved and restored without exposing its implementation details.
